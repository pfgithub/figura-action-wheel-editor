- [ ] improve the animation condition editor
- [ ] update the layout to be three panels horizontally: Action Wheels, 
- [ ] update actions to have a color picker. 
- [ ] redesign the action wheel section:
  - on the left: a list of action wheels with their actions
  - when you select an action, on the right add the editor for it
  - rather than a dropdown for main, you should be able to click 'set main' on an action wheel to set it as main
  - redesign the action editor to be more intuitive

- [ ] The toggle group editor is annoying. Remove the 'Toggle Groups' section and allow creating toggle groups and adding options to them directly from where you use them

- [ ] I forgot `label: string` in the Action type. Add it and update the action wheel display and action editor to use the label.
